          I am an aspiring junior web designer with creative ambitions. This portfolio contains websites for fictitious companies and highlights 
          my skills in web design and development. All of these use HTML and CSS.

            <p>In this project, I attempted to create a website for a media company. This is a fake company which “recruits” all kinds of media creators 
              and stars to one another to produce entertainment content. The goal was to make the site vibrant enough for users. I took inspiration from 
              sites with a similar theme like Spotify. I made a homepage, an “About” page, a “Posts” page, and a “Contact” page. While making this project, 
              I learned how to create detailed input forms.

            <p>This is my attempt at creating a shopping website. The goal was to give the site a very classy appearance as the theme was a fashion site. 
              I made mockup designs for a product and then placed those variations of a product in a catalog page. I also made a homepage to advertise the 
              product, and a “Statement” page to talk about the brand. I learned how to create aspect ratios for divs, properly fit images, and use 
              figcaptions.</p>

            <p>This is a "coming soon" landing page for a coffee shop. The goal of the site was to give off a relaxed feeling that one would get when they 
              visit a coffee shop. Hence, I used a lot of brown and light, neutral colors on the page. I created three divs for the background colors and 
              images and three divs for the form inputs and text.</p>

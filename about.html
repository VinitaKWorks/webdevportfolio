        <p>
          I am a aspiring junior web designer with knowledge in HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript (mainly jQuery and some vanilla JS). I currently 
          hold a BFA in Digital Media Art, which I have received from San Jose State University. I currently reside in Fremont, CA. Since I started 
          college, I had a strong interest for creating interactive media, especially websites. As of now, I am doing an internship at the University of 
          Michigan and am creating more work relating to multimedia in my free time. I am open to taking any new roles relating to web design or front-end 
          development. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I have additional skills in Figma and Adobe Creative Cloud. I am the most proficient in Photoshop, Illustrator, InDesign, and After Effects.
        </p>
        <p>
           I am open to any full-time, part-time, and freelance jobs. I can work onsite in Alameda County, San Jose, Santa Clara, and Palo Alto. I can work 
           remotely elsewhere and am able to adjust to any time zone.
